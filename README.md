# AdvWorks
The app is made on ASP.NET Core 7.0 and requires .net 7.0 and hosting bundle to work 
regarding to SQL, the Connection string can be configured on the appsettings.json,
and requires a valid SQL instance to be installed and the app can be built and run 
on Visual Studio 2022, (Though the app used to make this project was JetBrains rider
due that the fact to set up VSC2022 with .Net is more complex and time consuming for
a small web app), thanks.
